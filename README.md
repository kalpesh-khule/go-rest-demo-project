# go-rest-demo-project

##Why this project?
I am always asked to share the sample Go project that I worked on, along with the CV. Sometimes I am asked to share the link to my github account, so they can check my repos for sample projects.
However, most of my projects are bitbucket private repos. Also most of clients demand to sign NDA so I cannot share their code with third parties. Even if they haven't asked to do so, it's my moral responsibility to protect their assets and code.
This project is simple demonstration of "how I work with Golang" and should give general idea of my coding skills.
